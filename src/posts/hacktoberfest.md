Want to get involved in open source software but donâ€™t know where to begin? Weâ€™ve all been there! Hacktoberfest is a great incentive for people to start contributing back to the OSS community and you can get yourself some free swag ðŸ‘•. With the clock ticking down on Hacktoberfest â€” Iâ€™ve got a new open source project that youâ€™re more than to contribute to! [jest-extended](https://github.com/mattphillips/jest-extended) ðŸŽ‰

Do you use Facebookâ€™s amazing testing library [Jest](jestjs.io)? If you havenâ€™t then I definitely recommend you give it a try â€” amongst other things the developer experience of using it is second to none.

I recently found a feature of Jest that I thought was very cool!

### [`expect.extend(matchers)`](/)

You can use `expect.extend` to add your own matchers (assertions) to Jest. For example, letâ€™s say you wanted to check a value is `true`. You could abstract that into a `toBeTrue` matcher:

```js[class=line-numbers]
expect.extend({
  toBeTrue(given) {
    const pass = given === true;
    if (pass) {
      return {
        message: () => `expected ${given} not to be true`,
        pass: true,
      };
    } else {
      return {
        message: () => `expected ${given} to be true`,
        pass: false,
      };
    }
  },
});

test('true and false', () => {
  expect(true).toBeTrue();
  expect(false).not.toBeTrue();
});
```

This `extend` API got me thinking that it would be cool to have more specific Jest matchers. So Iâ€™ve decided to open source jest-extended as a new project to accomplish this.

In the spirit of Hacktoberfect I have created a series of [issues](/) for new matchers that I think would be useful to have as part of jest-extended but you can always raise an issue if you can think of others ðŸ™‚. Iâ€™ve labelled them with `New Matcher`, `Beginner Friendly` and `Hacktoberfest`.

Feel free to contribute by sending a pull request for any of the issues that arenâ€™t already being worked on, just put a comment on the issue that you would like to work on it so that others donâ€™t too. If youâ€™re new to GitHub and sending pull requests, then I recommend you check out [Kent C. Doddsâ€™s egghead course]() on contributing to open source projects.

Each new matcher should be beginner friendly and Iâ€™m more than happy to help out if you get stuck, so no excuses not to get involved ðŸ˜œ. A good place to start is the [contributing]() guide.

I look forward to seeing you over in the [**repo**]()!
